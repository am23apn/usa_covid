Finalized Research Question:
Is there a difference in the mean number of daily COVID vaccinations between American Samoa and Northern Mariana Islands in 2021 and 2023?

The decided question provides following insights

Did one territory achieve a higher vaccination rate during the initial phase due to better infrastructure or public acceptance?

Was one territory more successful in sustaining public interest in booster shots during 2023?

What challenges (e.g., vaccine hesitancy, access issues) might have caused disparities in daily rates between the territories?

How do differences in governance and resource allocation affect vaccination outcomes in these territories?
