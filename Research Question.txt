Great job everyone, we could not use the correlation questions as we have cummulation interval data which may get difficult to comprehend. The last question is an excellent suggestion we can refine it as

ONE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE !!!

We might not be able to deduce any meaningful and actionable insight or conclusion working with these specific locations. I have refined the question a bit. We are now working on District of Columbia and Alaska.
